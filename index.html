				<h1>Hello everyone, my name is Maxime Mery, get to know me !</h1>
				<img src="images/profile-picture.jpeg" class="img-circle" width="100px" alt="Maxime Mery">
				<p>
				I'm a business student currently in 1st year of bachelor at IESEG School of Management. I live near Paris and work at La Defense. I am a music lover who really enjoy singing, especially on stage, and discovering new albums ! Don't hesitate to make me a suggestion üòÅ My passion is to organize all sorts of events for friends, family or even people working with me. I thrive on looking for new ideas of original themes, trying to connect people with each other with special attention to making everyone feel included, and in general I love the idea of escaping from your daily life for a moment ! Just below you can find an example of a project I led in 2022 for my last year of high school.

				<h2>Music and DJing</h2>
				<p>
				I started my musician journey as a <strong>drummer</strong> when I was 15. I took lessons for a year before realizing I loved <strong>singing</strong> way more than drumming. I joined the musician group of my high school just when I got into it, and it was one of the best experience of my life ! I met people who became a little family year after year. We performed on stage various time and the last concert that I could do with them reunited more than 500 people. Truly an adventure of a lifetime. Now that I'm in college, I sing way less than in high school but occasionaly, you can find me singing in a local bar in Paris. Alongside this activity, I bought myself a DJ controller during the spring of 2022 and after practicing and failing a lot, I finally started <strong>DJing</strong> at parties ! So if you need a DJ that won't ask you for a huge amount of money but will still play some good tunes, hit me up !

				<h2>Organizing events</h2>
				<p>
				I organized my first ever party at the young age of 15 too ! To celebrate the end of the Brevet des Coll√®ges exams, I invited a bunch of friends at my house for a summer party. It obviously resulted in a mess because we were all pretty young, but times after times, parties after parties, I managed to organize <strong>8 other events</strong> at my house and <strong>one bigger project</strong> than all the other for my school. I like to call them events rather than parties because I took a lot of time to prepare each of them. Every time, I picked a theme, decorated my house entirely, prepared a music mixtape that would fit the theme and sometimes I would even put together a video to project on my TV that would show clips related to the theme (Halloween, summer festival...). In 2022, I was put in charge of organizing the school's parties, which were a Christmas ball and a prom night. Unfortunately, the ball was cancelled at the last moment due to Covid restrictions, but the prom was a huge success ! I worked with a team of students and together we organized <strong>La Golden</strong>, a party at the Club Haussmann which reunited more than 650 students. I had the occasion to work with a company which specialty is to help students organize parties. So if today you need help organizing your birthday party or just a regular event, you can contact me !
